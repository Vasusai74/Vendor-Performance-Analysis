# Vendor-Performance-Analysis

## Overview  
This project analyzes **retail vendor performance, inventory turnover, and sales efficiency** using **SQL, Python, and Power BI**. The study highlights vendor-wise profitability, stock movement, and risk exposure, providing actionable strategies to optimize procurement and reduce cost.



## Key Outcomes  
- Uncovered **$2.71M worth of unsold inventory** stuck in slow-moving vendor SKUs  
- Identified **65.7% supplier dependency**, exposing high concentration risk  
- Recommended diversification + bulk-buy strategy, leading to **72% projected cost savings**
